## ToDo:

### Development
- Battle VFX
- Status Effects and Healing Actions
- Camera Collision Avoidance
- AI Controllers (Battle Decision & Exploration Decision)
- Main Menu
- Collection Mechanics
- Monster exp and leveling
- Save Mechanics
- Multi battles

- Dynamic Controls (WASD/Click movement, QE/MidDepression rotation)

### Design
- UI Design (Kinda bland atm) (Still need main menu)
- Battle Feedback (Collection / Monster exp & leveling)

- Level Design (If not procedural)
- Chunk Design (If Procedural)
- Action Design and Balance
- Type efficacy matrix
